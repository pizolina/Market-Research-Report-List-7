<p><ul><li>Woven Gauze</li><li>Nonwoven Gauze</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The gauze wound dressing market comprises two primary types: woven and nonwoven gauze. Woven gauze is made from interlaced fibers, offering high absorbency and breathability, making it ideal for securing dressings and absorbing exudate.
