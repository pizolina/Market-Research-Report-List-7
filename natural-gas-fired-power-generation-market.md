<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Natural Gas-Fired Power Generation Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>CCGT</li><li>OCGT</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Natural gas-fired power generation includes two primary market types: Combined Cycle Gas Turbines (CCGT) and Open Cycle Gas Turbines (OCGT). CCGT systems enhance efficiency by using exhaust heat from gas turbines to generate additional electricity through steam turbines, making them suitable for steady, large-scale power generation. In contrast, OCGT systems provide quick-starting, flexible power generation, ideal for meeting peak demand or backup power needs, utilizing a simpler design that allows rapid deployment but operates less efficiently than CCGT.</p></p>
