<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Flexible Fire Resistant Sealant Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Elastometric Type</li><li>Intumescent Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The flexible fire-resistant sealant market is primarily divided into two types: elastometric and intumescent sealants. Elastometric sealants are designed to provide flexibility and elasticity, making them ideal for dynamic joints that may experience movement while maintaining a fire-resistant barrier. Intumescent sealants, on the other hand, expand when exposed to heat, forming a thick char layer that effectively seals gaps and prevents the passage of fire and smoke. Both types are essential for enhancing safety in construction and infrastructure projects.</p></p>
