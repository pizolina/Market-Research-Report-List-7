<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Fiber Optic Photoelectric Sensor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Through-beam Sensors</li><li>Retro-reflective Sensors</li><li>Diffuse-reflective Sensors</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The fiber optic photoelectric sensor market is categorized into three main types: through-beam sensors, retro-reflective sensors, and diffuse-reflective sensors. Through-beam sensors consist of a light emitter and receiver positioned apart, detecting objects when the beam is interrupted. Retro-reflective sensors utilize a reflector to bounce light back to the receiver, triggering detection when an object interferes. Diffuse-reflective sensors send and receive light in the same unit, detecting objects based on the light reflected off their surfaces. Each type serves specific sensing applications.</p></p>
