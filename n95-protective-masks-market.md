<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The N95 Protective Masks Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Mask with Exhalation Valve</li><li>Mask without Exhalation Valve</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The N95 protective masks market is divided into two main types: masks with exhalation valves and masks without exhalation valves. Masks with exhalation valves allow for easier breathing and reduce heat buildup, making them preferable for extended wear. However, they may not fully contain exhaled air, potentially compromising protection in certain situations. In contrast, masks without valves provide a tighter seal and better filtration efficiency, ensuring that both inhaled and exhaled air is filtered, which is essential in high-risk environments.</p></p>
