<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Biogas Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Wet Digestion</li><li>Dry Digestion</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Biogas systems are primarily categorized into wet and dry digestion markets based on the moisture content of the feedstock used. Wet digestion involves high moisture substrates, typically liquid or slurry forms, which facilitate anaerobic digestion, producing biogas efficiently in larger centralized plants. Dry digestion, on the other hand, handles solid feedstocks with lower moisture levels, ideal for decentralized systems. Each type serves specific waste management needs, agricultural applications, and energy production goals, making them versatile in the renewable energy landscape.</p></p>
