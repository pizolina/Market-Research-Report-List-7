<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Self Contained Breathing Apparatus Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Open-Circuit SCBA</li><li>Closed-Circuit SCBA</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Self Contained Breathing Apparatus (SCBA) market comprises two primary types: open-circuit and closed-circuit SCBA. Open-circuit SCBA releases exhaled air into the environment, suitable for short-duration operations, such as firefighting and rescue missions. In contrast, closed-circuit SCBA recycles exhaled air, providing a longer duration of oxygen supply, making it ideal for environments where air quality is compromised, such as in underwater diving or hazardous industrial work. Both types are essential for ensuring safety and respiratory protection.</p></p>
